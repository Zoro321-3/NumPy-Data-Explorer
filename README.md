# NumPy Data Explorer

A comprehensive Python project demonstrating NumPy fundamentals and advanced operations for data manipulation and analysis.

## 📋 Project Overview

This project is part of the **Syntecxhub Data Science Internship Program - Week 1**. It explores the essential features of NumPy, Python's fundamental package for scientific computing, through practical demonstrations and performance comparisons.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

- Master NumPy array creation, indexing, and slicing techniques
- Perform mathematical, axis-wise, and statistical operations on datasets
- Apply reshaping and broadcasting techniques for efficient computation
- Implement save/load operations for NumPy arrays
- Compare NumPy's performance with standard Python lists

## ✨ Features

### 1. Array Creation, Indexing & Slicing
- Create 1D, 2D, and 3D arrays
- Generate special arrays (zeros, ones, identity, random, range, linspace)
- Practice indexing and slicing operations
- Extract subsets of data efficiently

### 2. Mathematical & Statistical Operations
- Basic arithmetic operations (addition, multiplication, power, square root)
- Element-wise operations between arrays
- Statistical functions (mean, median, standard deviation, variance)
- Axis-wise operations along rows and columns

### 3. Reshaping & Broadcasting
- Reshape arrays to different dimensions
- Flatten and transpose arrays
- Demonstrate broadcasting with vectors and scalars
- Efficient computation with arrays of different shapes

### 4. Save/Load Operations
- Save and load single arrays (.npy format)
- Save and load multiple arrays (.npz format)
- Export and import arrays to/from text files

### 5. Performance Comparison
- Compare NumPy vs Python lists for:
  - Creation speed
  - Sum operations
  - Element-wise multiplication
  - Memory usage

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- NumPy library

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Zoro321-3/NumPy-Data-Explorer.git
cd NumPy-Data-Explorer
```

2. Install required dependencies:
```bash
pip install numpy
```

### Usage

Run the main script:
```bash
python numpy_data_explorer.py
```

The script will execute all demonstrations and create the following output files:
- `sample_array.npy` - Single NumPy array saved in binary format
- `multiple_arrays.npz` - Multiple arrays saved in compressed format
- `sample_array.txt` - Array saved in text format

## 📊 Sample Output

The program demonstrates:
- Array creation and manipulation techniques
- Statistical analysis on random datasets
- Performance metrics comparing NumPy vs Python lists
- Memory usage comparisons

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x** - Programming language
- **NumPy** - Numerical computing library
